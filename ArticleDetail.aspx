    <center> <h2>The Scriptures of Swaminarayan Sampraday</h2></center>

    <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Swaminarayan sampraday is thought of as having six organs:
    <br />
 
1.	Temples 
<br />
2.	Devo
<br />
3.	Scriptures
<br /> 
4.	Acharya
<br />
5.	Sadhu
<br />
6.	Satsangis
</p>
    <p>
<br />
 
&nbsp;For the whole of the sampraday, each of these organs is important in its own ways. This article is about scriptures.</p>
    <p>
    &nbsp;What is the importance of scriptures?
 
    
    
        </p>
    <p>
        Scriptures are the sacred writings. Normally, scriptures are considered the most authoritative source for any religion. The impact of scriptures is visible in principles and practices carried out at institutions and by their followers. For example:
    
   <br />
        •	Scriptures Uniquely Identifies Sampraday: The Scriptures are key to the identity of a religion or Sampraday. Scriptures provide guiding light for people as well as traditions. Behaviors and words are constantly judged in the context of scriptures. 
    <br />
    
        •	Scriptures provide essential help to mumukshu in choosing Guru: Niskulananad Swami says one should evaluate potential Guru over and over because his or her guidance will be the key to your spiritual progress. How can one evaluate a potential Guru? It is said that a mumukshu must know enough from scriptures to be able to choose Guru. One must know the potential Guru from the point of view of Scriptures. It is then that person be accepted as the Guru who will lead him or her to God.
        <br />•	Scriptures are key to the growth of a Sampraday: Shriji Maharaj states in Vachanamritm the scriptures are the key to the long term growth of a given Sampraday (Vachanamritm GII-58). The scriptures are immortal in a sense; they survive many of the great leaders of the Sampraday.
